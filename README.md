# SQL2pandas

**SQL commands in pandas**. 

SQL commands using Python pandas functions. This has the advantages:

• The functions can easily be stored for future use
   
• Can pass the output of one function in input to another

• Requires gificantly less code - SQL gets very clunky very quickly
   
• Functions can be made interactive 

More generally:

• Can (easily) run on command line and within analysis script for pipelines

• The complexity and size of the SQL standard means that most implementers do not support the entire standard – so may be some incomptability with peers
