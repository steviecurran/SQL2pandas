# SQL2pandas

**SQL commands in pandas**. 

SQL emulator using Python pandas functions. Has the advantages:

• The functions can easily be stored for future use
   
• Can pass the output of one fucntion in input to another

• Sigificantly less code 
   
• Functions can be made interactive 

More generally:

• Can (easily) run on command line and within analysis script for pipelines

• The complexity and size of the SQL standard means that most implementers do not support the entire standard – so may be some incomptability with peers
